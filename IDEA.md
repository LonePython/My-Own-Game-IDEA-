# My-Own-Game-IDEA

This is an Infinite Runner Game that basically revolves around SPEEDSTERS.
Speedsters are people who can run at superhuman and supersonic speeds. Eg:- Sonic the Hedgehog, The Flash etc.
Hence, this gives us the 2 main characters of this game with many minor ones also being present and other speedsters too (if I am able to add)

The main idea of this game is basically revolving around that of an Infinite Runner Game with the background and the ground resetting itself. The SPEEDSTERS may also be given the ability to shoot down the enemies/opponents. 

Characters:
Sonic
Flash
Enemies and other speedsters

Objective:
TO Reach the end by destroying all enemies

Rules:
Use the 'j' key to jump, left mouse to shoot and space bar to dash(a special effect in the game)
